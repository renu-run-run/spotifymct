 ## Local Storage
 -Typcally the React application's state is volatile.
 -Meaning, When we refresh the tab, the state is reset that time.
 -Because all the react states are in RAM memory.
 -Local Storage is the opposite of that.
 -Here the data is persistent.
 -Persistent mean that the data is stored on the hard disk. if might that the data is stored in the RAM memory but in reality it 
 is in the hard disk.
 -The data value is stored like a key value pair.
 -This value is string .
 - This functionality is provided by the Browsers via the Web API.
 - In order to see the Local storage , we can head overto the application tab and then on the left hand pane,
  we will find the loval storage . whcih will contain a list of all the domains which have created local storage items. 
  -each website have their own copy 

  ## HOC - (Higher order Components)-

  - these components can accept or return (or both) another component.
  -we can send any component as a child to another component, then that another component is said to be an Hoc.
  - This is similar to Higher order function. There we used to deal with function being passed as an argument Here we
   deal with components being passed like that.
   - for example Box, Card, Stack etc
